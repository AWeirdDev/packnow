# packnow
Pack everything now. Simple and (maybe) fast.

## 1. Get Packin'

```haskell
$ packnow
```

## 2. Get Hostin'
Note: You can also set a password for hosting.

```haskell
$ packnow host --file <zip file>
```

## 3. Just Get It!
...from other devices or platforms.

```haskell
$ packnow get --url <packnow url>
```
